import pygame as pg

# organisation : import image from image file and create an object with it -> Pygame rectangle to represent it for the soldier and circle for the target
# either create two small classes : Soldier and Target and make them inherit from pg.Rect()
# one button to generate 10 random targets =>
# when all targets are taken down, annouce that the game is over and allow to click the regenerate button
#
#
# **Moves logic : reflect the soldier's image depending on input (in this case : A and D/Left and Right arrows)
